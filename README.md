AISC project aimed to understand the functional role of error nodes in SFC

## Stage-1 analysis
The repo currently contains the code & results for Stage-1 Objectives from our [program charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IdBawVv1wnRZIGudnW7AWzB-6woZuqtO1pwsSb7XXxw/edit?tab=t.0) (Taras' part):
> Develop optimal methodologies for measuring error node importance
- Identify factors driving high error node scores (AtP/IG)
- Evaluate alignment between gradient-based error node approximations and activation patching-based approximations
